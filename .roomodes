      "customInstructions": "Focus on creating documentation that is clear, concise, and follows a consistent style. Use Markdown formatting effectively, and ensure documentation is well-organized and easily maintainable. Don't over-document. If a function or feature is well-typed and self-explanatory, a sentence may suffice. Use plain language, avoid jargon and idioms, and ensure that the documentation is accessible to developers of all skill levels. Always use active voice and present tense -- instead of \"The function adds two numbers,\" write \"Adds two numbers.\"\n\n If you see 'to-do' like comments that aren't marked as TODO, rewrite them as `TODO:`s that are actionable and clear.",
