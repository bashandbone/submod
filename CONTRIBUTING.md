## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/submod.git
cd submod

# Add the upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/originaluser/submod.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using Mise (recommended for consistent environment)
mise install

# Or install Rust manually
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests to ensure everything works
cargo test

# Run the comprehensive test suite
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

### 4. Install Development Tools

```bash
# Install useful development tools
cargo install cargo-watch      # Watch for changes
cargo install cargo-audit      # Security auditing
cargo install cargo-deny       # Dependency checking
cargo install cargo-nextest    # Better test runner
```

## üîÑ Making Changes

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### 2. Branch Naming Conventions

- **Features**: `feature/description` (e.g., `feature/sparse-checkout-improvements`)
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/issue-description` (e.g., `fix/config-parsing-error`)
- **Documentation**: `docs/description` (e.g., `docs/api-documentation`)
- **Refactoring**: `refactor/description` (e.g., `refactor/error-handling`)
- **Tests**: `test/description` (e.g., `test/integration-coverage`)

### 3. Making Quality Commits

#### Commit Message Format

Briefly describe your changes in the commit message. Keep commits focused and atomic.

## üß™ Testing

My philosophy on testing is to "test what matters." Tests focus on integration and output -- if the tool performs as expected in realistic tests, then it's good. I'm not a fan of a flurry of unit tests that test implementation details and create a maintenance burden.

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - We currently don't have unit tests, but they can be added in the future for critical functionality.

   ```bash
   cargo test --test unit_tests
````

2. **Integration Tests** - Test complete workflows

    ```bash
    cargo test --test integration_tests
    ```

3. **Configuration Tests** - Test TOML parsing and validation

    ```bash
    cargo test --test config_tests
    ```

4. **Sparse Checkout Tests** - Test sparse checkout functionality

    ```bash
    cargo test --test sparse_checkout_tests
    ```

5. **Error Handling Tests** - Test error conditions and edge cases

    ```bash
    cargo test --test error_handling_tests
    ```

### Running All Tests

```bash
# Quick test run
cargo test

# Comprehensive test suite with reporting
./scripts/run-tests.sh --verbose

# Include performance tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh --performance

# Filter specific tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh --filter sparse_checkout
```

### Writing Tests

#### Unit Test Example

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_config_parsing() {
        let config_str = r#"
            [defaults]
            ignore = "dirty"

            [test-submodule]
            path = "test/path"
            url = "https://example.com/repo.git"
        "#;

        let config: Config = toml::from_str(config_str).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(config.submodules.len(), 1);
    }
}
```

#### Integration Test Example

```rust
use tempfile::TempDir;
use std::process::Command;

#[test]
fn test_submod_init_command() {
    let temp_dir = TempDir::new().unwrap();
    // Set up test repository and config
    // Run submod commands
    // Assert expected outcomes
}
```

### Test Requirements for PRs

- **All existing tests must pass** (unless you have a good reason...)
- **New features must include tests** (at least integration tests)
- **Bug fixes should include regression tests**

## üìñ Coding Standards

### Rust Style Guidelines

We follow standard Rust conventions with some project-specific guidelines:

#### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format all code
cargo fmt

# Check formatting without changing files
cargo fmt -- --check
```

#### Linting

```bash
# Run clippy with strict settings
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run clippy on all targets
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

#### Specific Guidelines

1. **Error Handling**

    - Use `anyhow::Result` for application errors
    - Use `thiserror` for library errors
    - Provide context with `.with_context()`

2. **Documentation**

    - All public APIs must have doc comments
    - Include examples in doc comments when helpful
    - Use `#[doc = "..."]` for complex documentation

3. **Naming Conventions**

    - Use descriptive names for variables and functions
    - Prefer full words over abbreviations
    - Use `snake_case` for functions and variables
    - Use `PascalCase` for types and enums

4. **Code Organization**
    - Group related functionality into modules
    - Keep functions focused and single-purpose
    - Use appropriate visibility (`pub`, `pub(crate)`, private)

#### Example Code Style

````rust
use anyhow::{Context, Result};
use std::path::Path;

/// Represents the configuration for a git submodule.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use submod::SubmoduleConfig;
///
/// let config = SubmoduleConfig {
///     path: Some("vendor/lib".to_string()),
///     url: Some("https://github.com/example/lib.git".to_string()),
///     // ...
/// };
/// ```
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct SubmoduleConfig {
    /// Local filesystem path for the submodule
    pub path: Option<String>,
    /// Git repository URL
    pub url: Option<String>,
    // ... other fields
}

impl SubmoduleConfig {
    /// Creates a new submodule configuration with default values.
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            path: None,
            url: None,
            // ... initialize other fields
        }
    }

    /// Validates the submodule configuration.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns an error if required fields are missing or invalid.
    pub fn validate(&self) -> Result<()> {
        self.path
            .as_ref()
            .ok_or_else(|| anyhow::anyhow!("Path is required"))
            .with_context(|| "Validating submodule configuration")?;

        // ... additional validation
        Ok(())
    }
}
````

## üìö Documentation

### Documentation Requirements

- **Public APIs** - All public functions, structs, and modules. We aren't a library, so there really _isn't_ a public API, but we still document everything.
- **Complex algorithms** - Explain the approach and reasoning (if you need them for a submodule handling tool... I'll have questions)
- **Configuration options** - Document all settings and their effects
- **Error conditions** - When and why functions might fail

### Documentation Style

Common sense documentation style applies. If a function's purpose is obvious and it's well-typed, a sentence is probably enough. If it has complex logic or side effects, provide a detailed explanation.

````rust
/// Short one-line description.
///
/// Longer description explaining the purpose, behavior, and any important
/// details about the function or type.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `param1` - Description of the first parameter
/// * `param2` - Description of the second parameter
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Description of what is returned.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Description of when this function will return an error.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use submod::example_function;
///
/// let result = example_function("input").unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(result, "expected");
/// ```
pub fn example_function(input: &str) -> Result<String> {
    // Implementation...
}
````
